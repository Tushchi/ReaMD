[SIZE=5][B]ReaMD - Markdown Viewer with Scenario Linking, Teleprompter & AI Parse[/B][/SIZE]

Hey everyone,

I work in podcast production, radio dramas, commercials, and general radio sound design - with occasional dubbing projects on the side. For years I wanted a tool that could clean up messy scripts from producers and clients, and also serve as a simple teleprompter for voice sync sessions. With the help of Claude AI, I finally built it. Hope it helps you as much as it helps me!
